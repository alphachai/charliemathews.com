				<p>While this may not conform to the strict structure of a <em>eulogy</em>, there is no other word with which I can describe what I&#8217;m now writing. I wanted to put these things into words sooner. However, mom&#8217;s funeral came and went; it slid by me in a dull stupor of condolences, hugs, and tears. I will sing her praises here in the hope that one day, when my own memory of her has begun to slowly fade, I can remind myself of how much she loved me and of the significant role she played in my life.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<h3>Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.</h3>
				<p>Proverbs 31:28</p></blockquote>
				<p>Never has anything I&#8217;ve faced been quite so difficult as losing my mother &#8211; no pain I&#8217;ve ever experienced can compare. Only now that she has left us do I fully realize what an impact she had on my life. It&#8217;s especially hard living with the knowledge that nothing I could have done would have changed the outcome of this story. Even after watching her struggle for so many years, her steadfast fight became an unquestioned part of our family life. She was rigidly resolute in her conviction that God led her on a path of healing, and she strove constantly to reach the rejuvenated life of health which always seemed to lie just over the horizon. Surely, I&#8217;ve never known even one healthy, whole person who could keep up with my mom, even in the final days of her life. Although she had the worst of it, she still navigated life at full throttle, embracing challenges which others in her position would never dream of pursuing.</p>
				<p>Rose Elizabeth Collins Mathews. Born in September 24, 1962, she grew up in Mundeline, IL on the family farm. She attended Carmel High School and then Loyola University, going on to earn her medical PHD. She married Kevin Gerard Mathews, my dad, and had five children of which I am her eldest. If you had met my mom, you would have been amazed by her ever expanding pursuits.  She loved raising chickens, she fostered an ever expanding library in our basement, and she was constantly finding a room to re-decorate or some furniture to re-arrange. Mere weeks before she passed away, my dad walked in to find her upgrading the master bedroom curtains &#8211; on the ladder, drill in hand, oxygen cable dangling. Not even the illness she was stricken with could discourage her from getting things done. She was the one who always pushed me out of of my comfort zone and encouraged me when I hesitated to try new things.</p>
				<p>Mom was a fighter. She fought for everything she believed in and she did so with limitless passion. Whether that passion was channeled into practicing medicine, homeschooling her five kids, raising chickens, growing wheat-grass trays, or praising her savior and king, she pursued every interest with her whole being. She adored sharing her knowledge with anyone who would listen and learn. I watched her mentor so many women over the years, especially when they were receptive to her unconventional, yet evidently effective teachings. As I think back, I am most amazed by the empathy and compassion she constantly poured out for others. It didn&#8217;t matter whether you were her newest friend or one of her own children, she was always available to encourage and witness. No matter how much pain she was in, and she was in constant pain throughout the final years of her life, I hardly ever caught a glimpse of her struggle. In this light, her empathy for even the most miniscule of trials in my life astounds me now. To quote my sister, Kate, &#8220;&#8230;she always had a bright smile and a beautiful attitude toward everything.&#8221;</p>
				<blockquote>
				<h3>Her empathy for even the most miniscule of trials in my life astounds me now.</h3>

				<p>My mom&#8217;s relationship with the Lord was, by far, the most compelling aspect of her life. If she were here now, she would chide me for my praise, humbly reminding me how sin filled and broken she was. She was so self conscious of her own pride and always strove to help me avoid the same pitfall. I never had any kind of mentor growing up, and I had absolutely no desire to seek one out. Mom was always there, twenty-four seven, ready to hear my problems and point me to the high road. The Christian man I am today is a direct result of her constant, loving out-pour of Christ-like love into my life. The loss is so recent, the wound still freshly inflicted. I can&#8217;t imagine life without my mom. Yet, I&#8217;m living that life now, as unreal as it seems. Every time I receive a great grade, meet an interesting person, or just have a good day, my first thought is to call mom; every time, the burn of my already overflowing grief is reignited.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<h3>someone has reached into the core of my beating heart and ripped away the greatest love of my life</h3>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I know that she has walked through the gates of heaven and now stands before Christ, singing his praise among multitudes of others. However comforting this is, the pain that weighs on me presently can only be compared to the feeling of someone reaching into the core of my beating heart and ripping away the greatest love of my life, leaving a numb, aching wound in its place. This pain speaks immeasurably to the strength of the relationship I held with my mother; I have no better way to describe it than by attempting to measure the depth of the void she has left in my heart. I truly fear that I will forget her: the way she smiled when I hugged her, the joy in her eyes when I approached her after practicing the piano. I embrace each wave of grief because it brings the reassurance that my love for her has never wavered. Where could I possibly go from here? I brought to her my deepest thoughts when I needed encouragement and my greatest fears when I sought comfort. I step forward now, only because I know that He holds my broken heart in His gentle hands. Mom, thank you for shaping me into the god-fearing man I am today. Thank you for exposing me to new cultures, pushing me to try new things, and urging me to pursue Christ&#8217;s will in my life. Thank you for always being there for me, constantly pouring your sparse energy into building me up.</p>
				<p><em>May you rest in the Lord&#8217;s peace, mommy.</em> <em>3 / 2 / 2014 00:55</em></p>
